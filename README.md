### üìö About

Welcome to the Dog vs Cat Image Classification project! This repository showcases the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built using Keras and TensorFlow to distinguish between dog and cat images with remarkable accuracy.

In this project, you'll explore various methodologies to enhance model performance, including:

  - *Dropout Layers*: Techniques to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
  - *Data Augmentation*: Strategies to increase the diversity of your training dataset without actually collecting new data.
  - *Feature Extraction*: Utilizing pre-trained models to extract meaningful features from images.
  - *Fine-Tuning VGG16*: Leveraging the pre-trained VGG16 model on ImageNet and fine-tuning it to push the accuracy from ~72% to an impressive ~98%.
    
Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or an advanced practitioner aiming to refine your skills, this project provides a comprehensive guide to building and optimizing CNN models for image classification.
